# Enterprise Security Hardening Checklist

Complete security hardening checklist for production Claude Code Enterprise deployments. Use this for security reviews, compliance audits, and incident response planning.

## Network & Isolation

- [ ] **Air-gapped network**: Workstations have NO internet access (verified via `netstat`, `iptables`)
- [ ] **No VPN/proxy**: All external network calls disabled (`grep -r "proxy" ~/.claude/settings.json` returns nothing)
- [ ] **Network policy**: Firewall rules restrict outbound traffic (whitelist only essential services)
- [ ] **USB policy**: Physical security for air-gap bridges (USB restricted to specific devices)
- [ ] **No wireless**: WiFi/Bluetooth disabled on sensitive workstations (lsof -i for verification)

## Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] **SSO configured**: SAML 2.0 or OIDC setup complete (see `enterprise/SSO_SETUP.md`)
- [ ] **MFA enforced**: Multi-factor authentication mandatory for all users
- [ ] **JWT validation**: Local JWT validation for on-prem deployments (public key in `.claude/auth/`)
- [ ] **RBAC deployed**: Role-based access control configured in settings.json
- [ ] **No default passwords**: All credentials rotated after deployment
- [ ] **Session timeout**: Idle sessions timeout after 30 minutes (configurable)
- [ ] **Certificate pinning**: TLS certificate pinning enabled (if using managed Claudient Cloud)

## Secrets & Encryption

- [ ] **No secrets in code**: `.gitignore` includes `.env`, `secrets/`, `credentials/`
- [ ] **Secrets manager integrated**: AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or equivalent in use
- [ ] **Encryption keys stored offline**: Master keys in secure vault, not on disk
- [ ] **Encryption at rest enabled**: Audit logs encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- [ ] **Encryption in transit**: TLS 1.3 enforced for all network communication
- [ ] **Key rotation**: Schedule for quarterly key rotation
- [ ] **Public key infrastructure**: X.509 certificates from trusted CA (not self-signed in production)

## Audit Logging & Monitoring

- [ ] **Audit logging enabled**: `hooks.PostToolUse` configured for `audit-logger.sh`
- [ ] **Log retention**: Audit logs retained for 7+ years per compliance requirement
- [ ] **Log immutability**: Logs marked read-only after 24 hours (prevent modification)
- [ ] **Log encryption**: Audit logs encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] **Log backup**: Daily backups to secure, air-gapped storage
- [ ] **SIEM integration**: Audit logs shipped to Splunk/DataDog/ELK if applicable
- [ ] **Anomaly detection**: Alert on suspicious patterns (e.g., repeated PII detection)
- [ ] **Log review cadence**: Security team reviews logs weekly minimum

## PII & Data Protection

- [ ] **PII scanner enabled**: `security.pii_scanning` configured with action: "block"
- [ ] **Pattern coverage**: Scanner detects emails, phones, SSNs, credit cards, API keys
- [ ] **Custom patterns**: Organization-specific PII patterns added (e.g., employee ID)
- [ ] **Sanitization rules**: Secrets removed from audit logs automatically
- [ ] **Data minimization**: Claude Code only processes necessary project data
- [ ] **No local caching**: Claude Code disables local model caching (if using cloud API)
- [ ] **GDPR compliance**: Data retention policy documented and enforced

## Cost Control & Resource Enforcement

- [ ] **Cost cap enforcer deployed**: `hooks.PreToolUse` and `hooks.PostToolUse` configured

- [ ] **Team budgets**: Monthly budgets defined per team (platform, data, etc.)
- [ ] **Spend alerts**: Notifications at 80% threshold
- [ ] **Hard stops**: Cost cap enforcer blocks execution when limit reached
- [ ] **Cost attribution**: All spend tracked by user and team for chargeback
- [ ] **FinOps review**: Finance team reviews spend reports monthly

## File Access & Secrets Scanning

- [ ] **Secrets scanning**: Pre-commit hook scans for hardcoded secrets (optional: pre-tool hook)
- [ ] **File permissions**: Project directories have restricted permissions (`chmod 700`)
- [ ] **Log directory isolation**: `.claude/logs/` readable only by owner
- [ ] **No sensitive files in project**: No `.pem`, `.key`, `.crt` files checked in
- [ ] **Masked file paths**: Sensitive paths excluded from logs (via .gitignore, .claudeignore)
- [ ] **Read access control**: PII files restricted to need-to-know users (RBAC)

## Testing & Validation

### Manual Tests

```bash
# 1. Verify air-gap isolation
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED  # Should show NONE or only local connections

# 2. Test audit logging
claude code "test"
jq . .claude/logs/audit.log  # Should be valid JSONL

# 3. Test PII detection
# Try: Read a file with email addresses
# Should be BLOCKED or WARNED

# 4. Test cost capping
export CLAUDIENT_SESSION_CAP=0.01  # Very low cap
claude code "test"  # Should block after first tool call

# 5. Verify RBAC
# Login as "viewer" role, try to Write file
# Should receive permission error

# 6. Check encryption
file .claude/logs/audit.log  # Should show encryption info
```

### Automated Tests (CI/CD Integration)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# security-check.sh

# Scan for hardcoded secrets
git log -p | grep -i "password\|secret\|api_key" && echo "FAIL: Secrets found" && exit 1

# Check .gitignore
grep -E "\.env|secrets|credentials" .gitignore || echo "FAIL: Secrets not ignored" && exit 1

# Verify hooks are installed
[ -x .claude/hooks/audit-logger.sh ] || echo "FAIL: audit-logger.sh not executable" && exit 1
[ -x .claude/hooks/pii-scanner.sh ] || echo "FAIL: pii-scanner.sh not executable" && exit 1

# Validate settings.json
jq . .claude/settings.json > /dev/null || echo "FAIL: settings.json invalid JSON" && exit 1

# Check encryption is enabled
jq '.audit.encryption' .claude/settings.json | grep -q aes256 || echo "FAIL: Encryption disabled" && exit 1

echo "PASS: All security checks passed"
```
