# Marketplace Submission Process

Step-by-step instructions for submitting your stack to the Claude Code Marketplace via GitHub.

---

## Overview

The submission process takes 1–2 weeks from pull request to publication. You'll use Git and GitHub to propose your stack, automated systems will validate it, and the review team will assess quality. If revisions are needed, you'll iterate and resubmit.

**Timeline:**
1. Fork and prepare (30 min)
2. Submit PR (5 min)
3. Automated checks (5 min)
4. Initial review (1–3 days)
5. Revisions (if needed) (3–5 days)
6. Merge and publish (1 day)

---

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to https://github.com/tushar2704/Claudient
2. Click **Fork** in the top-right corner
3. Choose your GitHub account as the fork destination
4. Click **Create fork**

You now have your own copy of the repository.

---

## Step 2: Clone Your Fork Locally

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Claudient.git
cd Claudient

# Add upstream remote for syncing
git remote add upstream https://github.com/tushar2704/Claudient.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub handle.

---

## Step 3: Create Your Stack Directory

Create a directory for your stack in the `stacks/` folder:

```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch and synced
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create stack directory
mkdir -p stacks/your-stack-name-stack

# Initialize subdirectories (as needed)
mkdir -p stacks/your-stack-name-stack/{skills,agents,guides,hooks,mcp,examples}

cd stacks/your-stack-name-stack
```

**Naming convention:**
- Folder name: `kebab-case-stack` (all lowercase, hyphens, ends with `-stack`)
- Examples: `backend-productivity-stack`, `data-pipeline-stack`, `security-hardening-stack`

---

## Step 4: Build Your Stack

Populate your stack directory with complete, tested content:

```
your-stack-name-stack/
├── CLAUDE.md                          # Required: stack manifest
├── README.md                          # Required: overview and quick start

## Step 11: Automated Checks

When you create the PR, GitHub Actions automatically runs:

1. **Syntax validation**: Checks JSON files are valid, directory structure is correct
2. **File structure**: Verifies required files (CLAUDE.md, submission.json, LICENSE) exist
3. **Markdown linting**: Checks for formatting issues

If checks fail:
1. Review the error messages
2. Fix the issues locally
3. Commit and push the fixes
4. The PR automatically updates

---

## Step 12: Human Review

The maintainers review your submission (1–3 days). They check:

1. **Quality standards**: Do resources meet the published standards?
2. **Completeness**: Are all sections filled out with real content?
3. **Testing**: Is there evidence of external testing?
4. **Scope**: Is the stack focused and coherent?
5. **Documentation**: Are instructions clear and examples working?

---

## Step 13: Address Feedback

If reviewers request changes:

1. Review the comments on the PR
2. Make the requested revisions locally
3. Commit and push your changes
4. Reply to each comment confirming the fix
5. Reviewers re-check

Typical revisions take 3–5 days.

---

## Step 14: Merge and Publish

Once approved:

1. Maintainers merge your PR to `main`
2. Your stack is automatically published to the marketplace
3. You receive a confirmation notification
4. Your stack is now available for download

---

## After Publication

**Maintenance responsibilities:**

- Respond to GitHub issues (bugs, questions) within 1 week
- Update your stack when Claude Code releases major versions
- Keep examples and guides current
- Provide bug fixes as needed

**Earn certified badge (optional):**

After 2+ weeks with no issues, 2+ external users, and active maintenance, you can request certification. See **certification-path.md**.

---

## Troubleshooting

### PR checks fail with "Invalid JSON in submission.json"

**Fix**: Use an online JSON validator (jsonlint.com) to find the syntax error. Common issues:
- Trailing comma in arrays or objects
- Missing closing bracket
- Unescaped quotes in strings

### PR checks fail with "Missing required file: CLAUDE.md"

**Fix**: Ensure these files exist at the root of your stack:
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `submission.json`
- `LICENSE`
- `README.md`

### "Review is taking longer than expected"

The review team reviews stacks in order received. Typical time is 1–2 weeks. If you haven't heard in 3 weeks, comment on the PR asking for an update.

### I need to update my stack after it's published

**Minor updates (typos, small fixes):** Submit a PR with your changes. These merge quickly.

**Major updates (new skills, restructuring):** Comment on the original GitHub issue (created when your stack was merged). Discuss the scope and get approval before implementing.
