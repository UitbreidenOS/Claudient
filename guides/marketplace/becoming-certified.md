# Getting Your Stack Certified

This guide walks you through the step-by-step process of certifying your stack in the Claudient Marketplace.

## Prerequisites

Before applying for certification, ensure your stack:

1. **Is already published** in the Claudient Marketplace with positive feedback
2. **Meets baseline criteria** (see VETTING.md)
3. **Has a GitHub repository** (public, active, maintained)
4. **Meets minimum requirements** for your target tier:
   - Bronze: 10+ installs, 3.5+ rating
   - Silver: 50+ installs, 4.0+ rating, 6+ months active development
   - Gold: 200+ installs, 4.5+ rating, official maintainer endorsement

## Step 1: Evaluate Your Stack

Use the quality rubric in [certification-criteria.md](./certification-criteria.md) to assess your stack's readiness.

### Checklist

- [ ] Dependencies updated within last 3 months
- [ ] No known security vulnerabilities

**Adoption**
- [ ] Bronze: 10+ installs
- [ ] Silver: 50+ installs over 90 days
- [ ] Gold: 200+ installs over 180 days

**Satisfaction**
- [ ] Bronze: 3.5+ rating (5+ reviews)
- [ ] Silver: 4.0+ rating (10+ reviews)
- [ ] Gold: 4.5+ rating (20+ reviews)

**Maintenance**

## Step 2: Calculate Your Quality Score

Use the methodology in [certification-criteria.md](./certification-criteria.md):

```
Quality Score = (0.20 × Code Quality) + (0.20 × Adoption) + (0.20 × Satisfaction) + (0.20 × Maintenance) + (0.20 × Documentation)
```

Record scores for each dimension:

| Dimension | Score (0-100) |
|-----------|---------------|
| Code Quality | ___ |
| Adoption | ___ |
| Satisfaction | ___ |
| Maintenance | ___ |
| Documentation | ___ |
| **Composite Score** | **___** |

**Tier Eligibility:**
- 80-100 → Gold candidate
- 60-79 → Silver candidate
- 40-59 → Bronze candidate
