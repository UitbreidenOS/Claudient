# Stack Quality Standards

This guide defines what "quality" means for a stack submitted to the Claude Code Marketplace. Use this checklist before submitting your stack.

---

## The Quality Principle

A quality stack is:
- **Focused**: Solves a specific problem or supports a specific workflow
- **Complete**: Every skill, agent, and guide is finished; no placeholders
- **Tested**: You and 2+ others have used it in real work
- **Professional**: Clear writing, correct examples, no marketing fluff
- **Maintainable**: You will respond to bug reports and feature requests

A stack is NOT:
- A collection of random tools
- Early-stage or experimental
- Untested in real scenarios
- Abandoned or unmaintained

---

## CLAUDE.md Standards

Every stack must include a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root. It defines the stack's scope, governance, and guidelines for contributors.

**Required sections:**

```markdown
# Stack Name

## What This Stack Is
[2–3 sentences. What problem does it solve? Who uses it?]

## What's Included
[List of all skills, agents, guides, hooks, workflows, MCP integrations]

## Quick Start
[Copy-paste instructions: install the stack and use one skill/agent]

## File Naming Conventions
[Document your naming rules. Reference the main repository conventions.]

## Skill File Format
[Copy from main CLAUDE.md, or state: "Follows main repository standards"]

## Agent File Format
[Copy from main CLAUDE.md, or state: "Follows main repository standards"]

## Contribution Guidelines
[If you accept outside PRs: review process, standards, how to propose changes]

## When to Contribute
[Who can contribute, and how to propose new skills/agents for the stack]
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] CLAUDE.md exists and is complete
- [ ] No sections are left blank or marked "coming soon"
- [ ] Target audience is clearly stated
- [ ] File naming conventions are explicit

---

## Skill Standards

Every skill must follow the claudient skill format and meet these quality criteria.

**Format (required):**
```markdown
# Skill Name

## When to activate
[Specific triggers — not "when you need X"]

## When NOT to use
[Anti-patterns and misuse cases]

## Instructions
[Concrete steps, patterns, and techniques]

## Example
[Real, working example with input and output]
```

**Quality checklist:**

1. **Clear activation triggers**
   - [ ] "When to activate" is specific, not vague
   - [ ] Example: "When debugging a Docker container crash" (good) vs. "When you need help" (bad)
   - [ ] Triggers reference real Claude Code features (slash commands, tools, hooks)

2. **Concrete instructions**
   - [ ] No hand-holding; target senior developers
   - [ ] Instructions include code blocks where relevant
   - [ ] Each step is actionable, not advisory
   - [ ] Technical jargon is used correctly
   - [ ] No generic LLM advice ("think step by step")

3. **Real examples**
   - [ ] At least one example per skill
   - [ ] Examples show input, steps, and output
   - [ ] Examples are copy-paste runnable (not pseudocode)
   - [ ] Example addresses the stated activation trigger
   - [ ] If the example requires setup, include a setup section

4. **Error handling**
   - [ ] Instructions address "what if this fails"
   - [ ] Common errors are documented with fixes
   - [ ] Edge cases are noted

5. **Length**
   - [ ] 400–800 lines per skill (sweet spot for depth without bloat)
   - [ ] Longer skills should be split into multiple focused skills

**Common failures:**
- Skill is a general tutorial, not a Claude Code specific workflow
- Example is pseudocode or incomplete
- Instructions are vague ("try different approaches")
- No clear trigger condition
- Skill duplicates another in the stack

---

## Agent Standards

Every agent must follow the claudient agent format and meet these quality criteria.

**Format (required):**
```markdown
# Agent Name

## Purpose
[One sentence — domain or task ownership]

## Model guidance
[Haiku / Sonnet / Opus — with justification]

## Tools
[Specific tool subset; not all available tools]

## When to delegate here
[Specific trigger conditions]

## Example use case
[Concrete example of delegation]
```

**Quality checklist:**

1. **Clear purpose**
   - [ ] One-sentence purpose statement
   - [ ] Answers: "What does this agent specialize in?"
   - [ ] Not too broad ("backend specialist" is too broad; "SQL optimization specialist" is right)

2. **Justified model selection**
   - [ ] If Haiku: cost-sensitive task with simple logic
   - [ ] If Sonnet: balanced speed/cost/reasoning
   - [ ] If Opus: complex reasoning or multi-step research
   - [ ] Justification explains the choice

3. **Tight tool scope**
   - [ ] Lists 5–8 specific tools, not "all tools"
   - [ ] Tools align with the agent's purpose
   - [ ] Example: A SQL optimization agent doesn't need web search or email tools

4. **Concrete delegation triggers**
   - [ ] "When to delegate here" includes specific conditions
   - [ ] Example: "When you need to profile a slow query" (good) vs. "When database help is needed" (bad)

5. **Working example**
   - [ ] Example shows what the user asks and what the agent returns
   - [ ] Example is detailed enough to understand the agent's value
   - [ ] Example matches the stated purpose

---

## Guide Standards

Every guide must be complete, tested, and professional.

**Quality checklist:**

1. **Clear audience and purpose**
   - [ ] First sentence states who this is for
   - [ ] Clear problem statement or goal
   - [ ] "When NOT to use" section for anti-patterns

2. **Structured and navigable**
   - [ ] Headings logically progress
   - [ ] No wall-of-text sections (break into subsections)
   - [ ] Table of contents for guides over 1000 lines
   - [ ] Cross-links to related guides

3. **Concrete, actionable content**
   - [ ] Every instruction is step-by-step
   - [ ] Code blocks are syntactically correct
   - [ ] Copy-paste examples included
   - [ ] Screenshots or diagrams for visual workflows
   - [ ] No "as an exercise, implement X" — provide the implementation

4. **Tested and accurate**
   - [ ] You have completed all steps in the guide
   - [ ] All code examples work as written
   - [ ] Commands are tested on the stated OS (macOS/Linux/Windows)
   - [ ] Version numbers are current (or explicitly pinned for stability)

5. **Professional tone**
   - [ ] No marketing language ("this amazing tool")
   - [ ] No unnecessary jargon
   - [ ] Grammar and spelling are correct
   - [ ] Consistent formatting and style

6. **Length**
   - [ ] Minimum 100 lines; maximum 500 lines per guide
   - [ ] Longer topics should be split into multiple guides

## Workflow Standards

Every workflow must document end-to-end processes clearly.

**Quality checklist:**

1. **Clear objective**
   - [ ] First section states the workflow's goal
   - [ ] Target audience is specified
   - [ ] Time estimate to complete is provided

2. **Step-by-step process**
   - [ ] Each step is numbered and titled

   - [ ] Common failure modes and recovery steps
   - [ ] Troubleshooting section

5. **Example walkthrough**
   - [ ] Real example showing the workflow in action
   - [ ] All inputs, outputs, and decision branches demonstrated

## Hook Standards

Every hook must have correct configuration and clear documentation.

**Quality checklist:**

1. **Valid JSON configuration**
   - [ ] settings.json snippet is valid JSON
   - [ ] All required fields are present
   - [ ] Trigger type is one of: `before-start`, `after-command`, `on-event`

2. **Script quality**
   - [ ] Shell script (.sh) or Python script (.py)
   - [ ] Exits with code 0 on success, non-zero on error
   - [ ] Error messages are clear
   - [ ] No unhandled exceptions

3. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Explains what the hook does
   - [ ] Explains when/why it fires
   - [ ] Setup instructions are complete
   - [ ] Uninstall instructions are provided

4. **Safety**
   - [ ] Hook does not delete files without confirmation
   - [ ] Hook is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
   - [ ] Hook logs important actions for debugging

   - [ ] Troubleshooting section for common issues
   - [ ] Cost implications (if any) are disclosed

4. **Security**
   - [ ] API keys are passed via environment variables
   - [ ] No sensitive data in example configs
   - [ ] Documentation warns about rate limits or quota

## Grammar and Tone

All content must be professional, clear, and inclusive.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] American English spelling (or specify your region)
- [ ] No contractions in formal documentation
- [ ] Sentences are clear and concise
- [ ] No filler words ("basically," "just," "actually")
- [ ] Inclusive language (no gendered pronouns for people; use "they")
- [ ] No marketing fluff or hype
- [ ] Consistent tense (present tense for instructions, past for examples)

**Example corrections:**
- "You just need to run this command" → "Run this command"
- "This basically creates a Docker container" → "This creates a Docker container"
- "As you might know, DevOps is important" → "DevOps teams benefit from automation"
