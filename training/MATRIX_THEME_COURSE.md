### 3.2 Hands-On Lab: "Build a Conditional Theme Switcher"

**Objective:** Learner creates an automated system to switch Matrix variants based on project context.

**Lab Tasks:**

1. **Understand Theme Hooks**
   - Review `.claude/hooks/` directory structure
   - Study `settings.json` hook configuration
   - Example hook structure:
     ```json
     "hooks": {
       "on-project-load": "~/.claude/hooks/theme-on-project-load.sh",
       "on-time-change": "~/.claude/hooks/theme-on-time-change.sh"
     }
     ```

2. **Create Time-Based Switcher**
   - Write shell script: `~/.claude/hooks/theme-on-time-change.sh`
   - Logic:
     - 08:00-18:00: "matrix-work" variant (slightly higher contrast)
     - 18:00-08:00: "matrix-night" variant (reduced blue light)
   - Test by manually changing system time or via cron
   - Verify theme switches without restart

   **Example Script:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   HOUR=$(date +%H)
   
   if (( HOUR >= 8 && HOUR < 18 )); then
     # Day theme
     jq '.theme = "matrix-work"' ~/.claude/settings.json > /tmp/s.json
   else
     # Night theme
     jq '.theme = "matrix-night"' ~/.claude/settings.json > /tmp/s.json
   fi
   
   mv /tmp/s.json ~/.claude/settings.json
   ```

3. **Create Project-Based Switcher**
   - Write script: `~/.claude/hooks/theme-on-project-load.sh`
   - Detect `.git/config` or `package.json` to identify project type
   - Apply project-specific theme variant
   - Test by opening 2-3 different projects

   **Example Logic:**
   ```bash
   PROJECT_TYPE=$(grep -q '"devDependencies"' package.json && echo "web" || echo "generic")
   
   case $PROJECT_TYPE in
     web) THEME="matrix-web" ;;
     *) THEME="matrix" ;;
   esac
   ```

4. **Integrate with Shell Prompt**
   - Edit `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
   - Add function to display current Matrix theme in prompt
   - Test: open new shell, verify theme name appears in prompt

5. **Performance Baseline**
   - Measure theme load time: `time ~/.claude/hooks/theme-on-project-load.sh`
   - Document baseline (should be <50ms)
   - Identify any bottlenecks

6. **Documentation**
   - Create `~/.claude/matrix-hooks-README.md`
   - Document all installed hooks and their triggers
   - Provide troubleshooting steps

**Deliverables:**
- `theme-on-time-change.sh` (working and tested)
- `theme-on-project-load.sh` (working and tested)
- Updated shell prompt integration
- Performance baseline report
- README documenting all hooks

**Pass Criteria:**
- Both hooks execute without errors
- Theme actually switches when conditions trigger
- Performance is <100ms per hook
- Hooks survive system restart
- Documentation is clear and complete

**Time Estimate:** 60-75 minutes
