## Badges & Community Standing

### Q: Will losing my badge hurt my reputation?
**A:** 
- Expired badge (due to inactivity): Shows historical activity, no stigma
- Revoked badge (code of conduct): Serious indicator; noted on profile with reason
- Downgraded badge: Treated as renewal, not negative

### Q: Can badges be taken away?
**A:** Yes, but only for:
- Code of conduct violations (after review)
- Inactivity ≥24 months (automatic downgrade, reversible)
- Quality concerns (3+ rejected PRs, 6-month probation, then revocation)

Most expirations are simply automatic (non-renewal), not revocations.

### Q: If my badge expires, does my GitHub contribution history still show?
**A:** Yes! Your contributions remain on your GitHub profile and in UitKit's repository. Only the badge status changes. A badge expiration doesn't erase your work.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: I have 5 contributions but my badge hasn't been awarded yet. Why?
**A:** Check:
1. Are all 5 merged to `main` branch? (Not draft/PR stage)
2. Do they span ≥3 different directories? (e.g., skills/, workflows/, community/)
3. Is your account ≥6 months old?
4. Any code of conduct violations?

If all pass: System checks on the 1st of each month. You should see your badge then.

### Q: The badge verification page shows my name but says "unverified". What's wrong?
**A:** 
- This appears during the 2-week verification window after your PR merge
- Should resolve automatically; if not, contact: badges-support@uitkit.dev

### Q: My badge disappeared! Where did it go?
**A:** Check renewal status:
```bash
npm run badge:status <github-username>
```

If expired: You can reactivate by meeting renewal requirements and submitting a manual renewal application.

### Q: I'm a maintainer. How do I award badges to others?
**A:** See BADGE_ADMINISTRATION.md for admin commands and procedures.

### Q: Can I export or backup my badge?
**A:** Yes:
```bash
npm run badge:export <github-username>
```
