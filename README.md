**Claudient** is not a tool. It is a *knowledge system* — a community-maintained collection of everything you can drop into your Claude Code environment to immediately work faster, smarter, and with less friction.

## Why Claudient?

Claude Code is powerful out of the box. But the gap between "it works" and "it works at 10x" is filled with patterns most developers never discover on their own: the right skill for a task, a hook that enforces quality automatically, an agent that handles an entire domain, a workflow that turns a vague goal into shipped code.

Claudient collects all of that in one place — organized, searchable, and ready to use.

## Quick Start

**No installation required.** Clone the repo and copy what you need into your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Claudient/Claudient.git
```

**To use a skill** — copy the `.md` file into `.claude/commands/` in your project:

```bash
cp Claudient/skills/backend/python/fastapi.md your-project/.claude/commands/
```

Then trigger it in Claude Code with `/fastapi`.

**To use an agent** — reference it in your Claude session using the `subagent_type` parameter in your Agent tool calls.

**To use a hook** — add the hook JSON to the `hooks` array in your `.claude/settings.json`.

**To use a rule** — copy the content into your `CLAUDE.md`.

See [guides/getting-started.md](guides/getting-started.md) for a 5-minute setup walkthrough.

## Translations

All guides and documentation are available in:

- [English](guides/) (primary)
- [Français](guides/fr/)
- [Deutsch](guides/de/)
- [Nederlands](guides/nl/)
- [Español](guides/es/)

Skills, agents, and hooks remain in English — they are code-adjacent and translation adds noise without value.
