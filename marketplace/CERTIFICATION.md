## Quality Score Calculation

Each stack receives a composite quality score (0-100) based on:

| Metric | Weight | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Code Quality | 20% | Test coverage, linting, documentation completeness |
| User Adoption | 20% | Install count, weekly active users, trending velocity |
| User Satisfaction | 20% | Average rating, review sentiment, issue resolution rate |
| Maintenance | 20% | Days since last update, dependency freshness, issue response time |
| Documentation | 20% | Completeness, clarity, example quality, accuracy |

**Score Interpretation:**
- 80-100: Gold tier candidate
- 60-79: Silver tier candidate
- 40-59: Bronze tier candidate
- Below 40: Not eligible for certification

---

## Recertification

All certified stacks undergo annual recertification:

**Bronze stacks:**
- Must maintain minimum install count (10)
- Average rating stays above 3.5
- No unresolved critical issues
- Author confirms intent to maintain

**Silver stacks:**
- Must maintain minimum install count (50)
- Average rating stays above 4.0
- Quarterly updates required
- Issue response SLA maintained

**Gold stacks:**
- Must maintain minimum install count (200)
- Average rating stays above 4.5
- Monthly updates required
- Issue response SLA maintained
- Maintainer endorsement renewed

If a stack fails recertification, it is downgraded one tier. If it fails at Bronze tier, certification is revoked.

## Decertification

Certification is immediately revoked if:

1. **Code of conduct violation:** Prohibited content discovered in stack or author conduct
2. **Critical security issue:** Unpatched vulnerability affecting user systems
3. **Licensing violation:** Use of incompatible or undisclosed licenses
4. **Abandoned:** No author response for 3 months after recertification review
5. **Hostile maintenance:** Author actively prevents improvements or ignores critical issues

Revoked stacks are delisted from certified indexes but remain in marketplace (if no violations). Authors can apply for re-certification after 6 months.
