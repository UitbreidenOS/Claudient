# Claudient Marketplace

The official hub for discovering, sharing, and installing expert stacks for Claude Code. Claudient transforms Claude into specialized professionals across engineering, data, business, operations, and creative domains.

## What is Claudient?

Claudient is a curated marketplace of **specialized stacks** — complete knowledge systems bundled with skills, agents, hooks, workflows, and prompts. Each stack equips Claude Code with expert-level guidance for a specific profession or domain.

Think of a stack as a persona with muscle memory: domain expertise, best practices, tool integrations, and runnable patterns designed by practitioners.
