   # Verify README exists
   cat your-stack-name/README.md

   # Verify STACK.json
   cat your-stack-name/STACK.json
   ```

### Step 2: Test Locally

Install your stack in development and verify it works:

```bash
# Link your stack to Claude Code
ln -s "$(pwd)/your-stack-name" ~/.claude/marketplace/your-stack-name

# Verify in Claude Code
claude stack list

# Test at least one skill
# Start a Claude Code session and run: /<skill-name>
```

   ```

2. **Add your stack files:**
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/your-stack-name/* .
   ```

3. **Create a LICENSE file** (MIT, Apache 2.0, or CC-BY-SA-4.0):
