## Best Practices

[EDIT ME: 2-3 best practices for using this stack effectively. Example:

1. **Always validate assumptions** — Before acting on analysis output, verify with primary data
2. **Document decisions** — Record why you chose option A over B for future reference
3. **Iterate quickly** — Use the framework iteratively; don't wait for perfect information]

## Example Workflow

**Scenario:** [EDIT ME: Describe a realistic scenario]

```
1. [Step 1 — what happens]
2. [Step 2 — which skill to activate]
3. [Step 3 — what output you get]
4. [Step 4 — what action to take next]
5. [Final outcome]
```

[Brief explanation of why this workflow makes sense and when you'd repeat it.]
