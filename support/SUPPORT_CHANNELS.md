## Best Practices

### Before Contacting Support

1. **Check documentation:** Review CLAUDE.md, README.md, and relevant guides
2. **Search existing issues:** Use GitHub Issues/Discussions search to find similar problems
3. **Gather information:**
   - Claude Code version: `claude --version`
   - Node.js version: `node --version`
   - OS and architecture
   - Relevant logs and error messages
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)

### When Creating an Issue/Discussion

- **Be specific:** Avoid vague descriptions like "it doesn't work"
- **Include environment details:** Version numbers, OS, configuration
- **Provide reproducible examples:** Exact steps, minimal code samples
- **Share context:** What were you trying to do? Why?
- **Mention what you've tried:** Shows effort and helps narrow scope

### In Discord Conversations

- Use threads to keep conversations organized
- @mention team members only when necessary
- Avoid reposting the same question; wait for responses
- Provide additional details in follow-ups rather than new messages
- Link to related GitHub issues for context

## Escalation Path

If your issue is not being resolved:

1. **Initial attempt:** Post in appropriate channel with full context

3. **Still unresolved:** Escalate via email to support@claudient.io with:
   - Original GitHub issue/discussion link or Discord message timestamp
   - Summary of attempts so far
   - Business impact and urgency
   - Requested timeline
